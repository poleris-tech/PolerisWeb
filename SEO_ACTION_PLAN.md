## Why You're Not Ranking Yet 🔍

The main issue is **domain authority and backlinks**. Your domain is new (2024), and Google needs to see:
1. Other websites linking to you
2. Actual content proving expertise
3. Consistent search behavior

Even with perfect on-page SEO, a brand new domain takes time.
